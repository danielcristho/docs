## **Set Static IP Addresses for Services using IPAM**

In Docker Compose, you can assign static IP addresses to your containers within a custom network. This ensures consistent communication between services, especially when specific IP addresses are required. [Docker Compose Network](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/networks/)

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**
> Use a unique subnet (e.g., `172.99.0.0/24`) to avoid conflicts with existing networks. Verify active Docker networks by running:
>
> ```sh
> docker network ls
> ```
