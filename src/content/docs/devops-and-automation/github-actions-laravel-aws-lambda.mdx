lastUpdated: true
---

> This workflow automates the deployment of a Laravel project to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) using the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com). It installs necessary dependencies, sets up PHP, and runs `serverless deploy` to push the application to AWS Lambda.

```yaml
name: Deploy Laravel Project to AWS Lambda

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: 8.2

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: composer install

    - name: Install Serverless Framework
      run: npm install -g serverless

    - name: Deploy to Lambda
      run: serverless deploy
      env:
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: <your_best_region>
```

### Requirements

- Serverless Framework: Installed in the workflow using `npm install -g serverless`.
- Using [shivammathur/setup-php](https://github.com/shivammathur/setup-php) to setup PHP in workflow.
