```yaml
name: Access Server via GitHub Actions
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: SSH to server and running some commands.
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v0.1.10
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          port: ${{ secrets.SSH_PORT }}
          script: |
            cd /var/www/my-project && git pull origin main
            # Add another commands here
```

## Requirements

- Server must allow SSH connections with a valid key.
- Set `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USER`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `SSH_PORT` in GitHub Secrets.
- Use [appleboy/ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action) to execute commands on the server.
