title: "GitHub Actions: Deploy Static Site to Cloudflare Pages"
lastUpdated: true
---

## First Scenario

> Deploy directly from GitHub Actions to Cloudflare Pages and using [wrangler-action](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler-action) for authentication & deployment.

```yaml
name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Build Project
        run: pnpm build

      - name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3
        with:
          apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}
          accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}
          projectName: "frontend-pages"
          directory: "<dist_or_out>"
```

### Requirements

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` & `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`. See more here: [Cloudflare: GitHub Actions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/external-cicd/github-actions)
- Ensure pnpm or npm is installed in the workflow.

## Another Scenario

> Deploys from a VPS/server that has a public IP, then uploads from the server to Cloudflare Pages. Useful for custom processing (e.g., caching, logs, pre-processing).

```yaml
name: CF | Upload Static Site from Server
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: SSH to server, run pnpm commands and upload static site to CF Pages
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v0.1.10
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
          port: ${{ secrets.SSH_PORT }}
          script: |
            cd /var/www/frontend && git pull origin main
            export PATH=/root/.local/share/pnpm:/root/.nvm/versions/node/v20.18.0/bin:$PATH
            pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && pnpm build
            CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}" npx wrangler pages deploy /var/www/frontend/<dist_or_out> \
            --project-name=frontend-pages
```

### Requirements

- Requires `wrangler` CLI on the server. Follow this step to install wrangler: [Install/Update Wrangler
](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- Using [appleboy/ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action) for SSH access (SSH_HOST, SSH_USER, SSH_PRIVATE_KEY).
- pnpm/npm and Node.js are installed on the server.
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` set in the server environment.
