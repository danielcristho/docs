## Common Android Studio Issues & Solutions

**Error Message:**

```
Process "/app/extra/android-studio/bin/studio" (2) is still running.
If the process is an instance of the IDE, please collect the logs and contact support.
If it isn't, please delete the stale "/home/.var/app/com.google.AndroidStudio/config/Google/AndroidStudio2024.3/.lock" file and restart the IDE.
```

> The message appears because Android Studio detects that there are still processes running (possibly from a previous session), and therefore the `.lock` file is not deleted normally.

**Solution:**

```bash
$ ps aux | grep studio
```

```bash
$ killall studio
or
$ pkill -f studio
```

```bash
rm ~/.var/app/com.google.AndroidStudio/config/Google/AndroidStudio<VERSION>/.lock
```

```bash
rm ~/.var/app/com.google.AndroidStudio/config/Google/AndroidStudio2024.3/.lock
```
